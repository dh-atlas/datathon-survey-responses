# Task Resources

This folder contains the CSV files with the list of resources used during the datathon task of the **ATLAS Workshop** held on **March 26, 2025**.

These resources were selected as examples of digital outputs in the field of **Digital Humanities**, with a specific focus on the **Italian Digital Cultural Heritage**. The categories represented include:

- **Digital Scholarly Editions**
- **Text Collections**
- **Ontologies**
- **Linked Open Data**
- **Software**

The list is **exemplary**, and does not aim to provide an exhaustive overview of international research in this domain. Rather, it offers a **representative sample** of projects and products relevant to the ATLAS platform and its ontology-driven approach to research documentation.

These resources were used by participants as the basis for the task during the datathon, where they were asked to describe one or more of them using the ATLAS web application.

For more information about the workshop and survey, see the main [README file](../README.md).
