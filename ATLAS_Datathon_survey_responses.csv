26/03/2025 16:30,Yes,4,I did not use the automatic extraction - it would be good to test that as the dc metadata would have spared time. I also did not include all fields even if they were actually there. I assumed I could go back and refine but I can't nopr I can see a previous of what I added.,3,3,Dropdown or pre-filled values were helpful as well as existing entities.,"Not all Lookup tables opened correctly (e.g. data files, taxonomies); also there were no definition for the fields in text even if minimal - that would have helped.",4,4,the open source crowdsourced catalogue,

I then realized I had to select one to understand what you meant by that category. It would be helpful to have descriptions of the objects on the side, which are already opened for all the objects.

Also, the forms are large, meaning that each textbox takes up more space than it needs. It would have been important to group them up based on themes instead of listing them one after the other. 

During the Datathon, I was afraid the connection would stop and I could lose all my progress, so I saved the entry before it was complete. I expected to see the form with the data just saved to easily check for any mistakes. Or even to be on the ""create new resource"" page ready to add another entry.

Also, I find the two-step creation of data a bit strange (choose the template and then save). What happens when I save an ""empty"" template?   

Another important point was the Explore section. I would have expected to see a list of data that I could filter and order, but I believe that a list is very valuable to start explore even when the users do not know what they want to find."

- The languages buttons are very slow (idk if it's using AJAX to fill the options but it would probably work faster with a fixed options list from an imported HTML)
- Also, usability wise, I would often click ""Change current string Language"" instead of add language, so I would suggest to separate the insert new label button
